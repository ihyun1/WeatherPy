# WeatherPy

## Overview
In this project, we have created a program that generates various vacation destinations and multi city driving itinerary utilizing input statements from beta testers.

Resources

APIs: Open Weather Map, Google Maps Directions API
Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook
Dependencies: random, numpy, pandas, gmaps, matplotlib

## Results
We successfully created a four city trip driving route using Google Maps Directions API. The four cities were selected from a dataframe of cities based on a minimum and maximum temperature for their vacation destination from a user's input statement. We generated the dataframe by calling the Open Weather Map API.
